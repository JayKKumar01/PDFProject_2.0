## PDF Comparison and Modification Application

### **Introduction:**
This application provides a comprehensive solution for comparing and visualizing differences between two PDF documents. The process involves multiple steps, each contributing to the overall functionality of the program.

---

### **Step 1: Main Method Execution (`Launcher` Class):**
- The main entry point of the application is the `Launcher` class.
- It initializes the required components and orchestrates the overall flow of the application.
- The `Launcher` class is responsible for interacting with the user, obtaining input parameters, and invoking subsequent steps.

---

### **Step 2: PDF Conversion (`WordToPdfConverter` Class):**
- Before comparing PDFs, it is essential to convert any Word documents to PDF format.
- The `WordToPdfConverter` class handles the conversion process using the `documents4j` library.
- Word documents are converted to temporary PDF files for further processing.

---

### **Step 3: PDF Text Extraction (`PDFWordExtractor` Class):**
- The `PDFWordExtractor` class extracts text information from the PDF documents.
- It uses the `pdfbox` library to parse PDF content and identify words along with their attributes.
- The extracted text information is stored in `WordInfo` objects for further analysis.

---

### **Step 4: Word Information Processing (`WordInfo` Class):**
- The `WordInfo` class encapsulates information about words in the PDF, including their text, position, and formatting details.
- Different constructors accommodate various scenarios, such as creating `WordInfo` objects for individual words, words with specified operations, or words with associated text positions.
- Methods within the class facilitate the retrieval of font-related details, font style, and font size.

---

### **Step 5: Word Comparison and Analysis (`TextComparator` Class):**
- The `TextComparator` class handles the comparison of words between two PDFs.
- It identifies added, deleted, and unchanged words, storing the results in `StringDiff` objects.
- The comparison process utilizes the `daff` library for string differences and the `TextDiff` class for text-based differences.

---

### **Step 6: String Difference and PDF Modification:**
#### 1. **StringDiff Class:**
   - The `StringDiff` class compares two strings using the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm.
   - Differences are represented using HTML-like tags to highlight additions and deletions.

#### 2. **ModifyPdf Class:**
   - The `ModifyPdf` class facilitates modifications to existing PDF documents.
   - It uses the `pdfbox` library to manipulate PDF content, highlighting added and deleted text based on differences identified by the `StringDiff` class.

#### 3. **PDF Text Modification:**
   - `ModifyPdf` incorporates methods to annotate and visually represent differences in PDF content.
   - Differences identified during the text comparison process are used to modify PDFs, allowing users to view highlighted changes.

---

### **Step 7: PDF to Image Conversion (`PDFToImageConverter` Class):**
- The `PDFToImageConverter` class handles the conversion of PDF pages to images.
- It utilizes the `pdfbox` library to render each page as an image, considering the specified DPI (dots per inch).
- The images are stored as `BufferedImage` objects for further processing.

---

### **Step 8: Combine Images of Both PDFs (`PDFToImageConverter` Class Extended):**
- The `PDFToImageConverter` class is extended to handle the combination of images from both PDFs.
- It loads images from each PDF and combines corresponding pages side by side.
- The combined images highlight differences by presenting content from both PDFs.

---

### **Conclusion:**
The application now includes an extended capability to combine images from different PDFs, providing a visual representation of differences in corresponding pages. This enhancement facilitates a comprehensive analysis of both text and image content within PDF documents.
